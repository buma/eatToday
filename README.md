EatToday
========

Food manager
-----------

You can use it to store what you eat to count calories. It can also store best before dates of items, so you know when will things expire. And it can store prices. So you can see which items are cheapest per kg or per kcal/protein which is not always the same. And some items cost differently in different stores.
Because nutrition data from USDA also has micronutrients and vitamins it is also possible to show those in chart view. In mg or as % of daily needs.

It is also possible to compare weekly/monthly eating ranges to see what was eaten before but not now.

Nutrition data is stored the same as in [gourmet](https://github.com/thinkle/gourmet) USDA nutrition database so I wrote scripts to import specific ingredient when I want it.

It also has notification script to remind you to eat something.
